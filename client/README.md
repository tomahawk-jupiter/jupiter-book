# Social App Design Notes

Start with `npm start`. The backend api must also be running.

## Context React

I use context react to store the current user after they have logged in.

## Extra things to add

- Add an input for a profile pic in `register page`. Url or file.
- Add a chat feature.
- So far I have not protected the backend routes but I could do this with Passport.js using sessions or tokens.
